Description: This GitHub repository houses a cross-platform desktop application that utilizes MongoDB for data storage and visualization. The application leverages both a local MongoDB database and the online MongoDB Atlas service for seamless data management. With this application, you can store, retrieve, and manipulate data locally using MongoDB, as well as synchronize and access your data from anywhere using MongoDB Atlas.

Key Features:

Cross-platform compatibility: The application can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Local and online database integration: Utilize a local MongoDB database for offline data storage and seamless synchronization with MongoDB Atlas for online access.
Data visualization: Leverage the power of MongoDB's data aggregation capabilities to create interactive charts and visualizations within the application.
Web application support: Extend the functionality of the desktop application by building web-based applications that interact with the same MongoDB database.
Whether you are building a data-driven desktop application or exploring the capabilities of MongoDB for data storage and visualization, this repository provides a solid foundation for your project. Feel free to contribute, customize, and enhance the application to suit your specific needs.
